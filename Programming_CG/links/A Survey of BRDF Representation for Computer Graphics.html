<blockquote>
Whether they are generated from theoretical models or measured, BRDFs for
computer graphics need efficient representations.  We examine the
representations that have been proposed, including data tables, analytic
models, splines, spherical harmonics, wavelets, and Zernike polynomials.  This
evaluation suggests that most are lacking in flexibility, compactness, or
computational efficiency.  We propose some approaches to improving on these
methods by making greater use of the symmetry of BRDFs.

<h3>
1  Introduction: BRDFs for Computer Graphics
</h3>
<p>
Historically, the reflection properties modeled by computer graphics renderers
have been limited.  Despite their physical inaccuracy, simple models such as
the Phong model remain popular.  True photorealism, however, requires more
sophisticated and elaborate models of surface properties.
</p><p>
It is difficult to establish exactly how far one should go in elaborating the
surface model.  A truly complete representation of the reflective behavior of a
surface might take into account such phenomena as polarization, scattering,
fluorescence, and phosphorescence, all of which might vary with position on the
surface.  Therefore, the variables in this complete function would be:
</p><ul>
<li> incoming and outgoing angle
</li><li> incoming and outgoing wavelength
</li><li> incoming and outgoing polarization (both linear and circular)
</li><li> incoming and outgoing position (which might differ due to subsurface
scattering)
</li><li> time delay between the incoming and outgoing light rays
</li></ul>
This is clearly too many variables to be practical for computer graphics work. 
Therefore, we will consider only a restricted subset of surfaces, assuming that
color can be represented as just an RGB triplet, and ignoring subsurface
scattering, fluorescence, phosphorescence, and polarization.  In addition, we
will for the moment ignore all spatial variation, leaving us with a reflectance
function of just the two angles.
<p>
Once we have eliminated all these variables, we are left with a reflectance
function of the angles of the incident and reflected angles only.  This
function is called the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). 
The BRDF is defined on the cross product of two hemispheres, and is therefore a
function of four (scalar) variables:
</p><p align="center"><img src="./A Survey of BRDF Representation for Computer Graphics_files/eqn1.gif" alt="BRDF = dL_r(theta_r, phi_r) / dE_i(theta_i, phi_i),"></p>
<p>
where <i>E</i> is the irradiance, that is the incident flux per unit area, and
<i>L</i> is the reflected radiance, or the reflected flux per unit area per
unit solid angle.  The units of BRDF are thus inverse steradians. 

Intuitively the BRDF represents, for each incoming angle, the amount of light
that is scattered in each outgoing angle.  For a Lambertian (perfectly diffuse)
surface, for example, the BRDF is constant, and equal to
</p><p align="center"><img src="./A Survey of BRDF Representation for Computer Graphics_files/eqn2.gif" alt="BRDF_L = rho_0 / pi."></p>
<p>
(The factor of pi is necessary so that the BRDF is correctly normalized.)
More complicated BRDFs will, of course, have angular dependence.

</p><p>
BRDFs to be used in rendering may either be obtained from theoretical models of
reflection at a surface, or may be measured directly.  Each of these presents
its own set of challenges.  In either case, however, the result is a
four-dimensional function (ignoring color for the moment), and efficient
methods of storing and computing this function must be found.  There are many
methods presented in the literature, varying in flexibility, physical
correctness, and space and time efficiency.
</p><p>
In this paper we will explore some of the issues in acquiring and representing
BRDFs.  We will start with a look at the papers on BRDFs arising from physical
models, Monte Carlo simulation, and actual measurement.  Then, we will consider
the various papers on BRDF storage and representation, focusing on the
tradeoffs in correctness, flexibility, and efficiency.  Finally, we will
present some new ideas on how to make BRDF storage more efficient, and how to
re-introduce some of the dimensions we removed earlier.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
2  Acquiring BRDFs
</h3>
<p>
The BRDFs used in computer graphics can be either computed from analytical
models or captured.  We will look at several papers representing the state of
the art in both cases.
</p><p>
</p><h4>2.1 Theoretical models for BRDFs</h4>
<p>
Over the past twenty years, a variety of physically-based BRDF models of
increasing sophistication have been proposed.  We will look closely at one of
the more recent, and more complex, models in this series, namely that proposed
by [He 91].  This model contains most of the features common to these models,
starting with specific assumptions about the surface microgeometry, and
considering factors such as as self-shadowing, Fresnel reflection, the effects
of the wave nature of light, and subsurface scattering.  The result is a model
with a small number of parameters that can, at least in theory, be measured
from an actual surface.
</p><p>
Most of the currently popular theoretical models start with the assumption that
the large-scale BRDF is the result of fine-scale roughness of the surface. 
This roughness is described by a collection of <i>microfacets</i> with random
sizes and orientations.  The statistical distribution of sizes has
traditionally been taken to be Gaussian, because this distribution is easy to
work with and has many mathematically-desirable properties.  Each facet is
taken to be a perfect reflector, obeying the physical laws of reflection for
dielectrics.  It is assumed that light can interreflect off of several facets
before leaving the surface, and that the facets, due to their orientations, can
occlude each other.  In addition, He's model assumes that the facets might be
of size comparable to the wavelength of light.  This means that the wave nature
of light, and hence phenomena such as interference, must be taken into account. 
The final model for the BRDF is extremely complex, but agrees well with actual
measured BRDFs.

</tbody></table></center>
<p>
This model does a good job of accounting for the many physical phenomena seen
as a result of a rough-surface model, and predicts actual observed phenomena
better than older, simpler models.  It cannot, however, make any predictions
for surfaces that cannot be modeled as having randomly-oriented microfacets. 
In particular, it cannot model any <i>nonisotropic</i> surfaces.  These are
surfaces, such as woven cloth or brushed aluminum, for which the BRDF is not
independent of azimuth.  Therefore, He's model, despite its complexity, is
clearly inadequate for predicting all BRDFs that could potentially be of
interest in computer graphics.
</p><p>
Instead of extending the purely theoretical models to surfaces of more complex
microgeometry, [Westin 92] adopts a simulation-based method of determining the
BRDFs of more complex surfaces.  Since they are able to start with any desired
microgeometry, there is no inherent restriction on the kinds of surfaces their
method can model.  For example, they have been able to model the reflection
characteristics of velvet and brushed aluminum.

<p>
The process begins with a scene of arbitrary geometry, representing the
microgeometry of a small surface patch.  Since the scene is used as input to a
ray tracer, the surfaces within the scene can use any known BRDF, and can even
be made transparent.  The ray tracer follows light incident at random points on
the sample as it bounces around the scene, and eventually is scattered back. 
The algorithm computes, for each incoming angle, the average amount of light
reflected into each outgoing angle.  Thus, the algorithm approximately
determines the BRDF of a surface patch having the given microgeometry.
</p><p>
</p><h4>2.2 Direct measurement of BRDFs</h4>
<p>
As an alternative to computing a BRDF from some model, one might try to
measure the reflectance properties of some sample. The technical challenges
involved in doing this are considerable, partly because of the fact that the
BRDF is a function of four dimensions.  In addition, there are problems with
light source and camera stability, with variations in surface geometry, and
with interreflection.  In fact, one recent survey of BRDF measurement
laboratories found huge variations in the results reported for identical
samples.  [Leonard 93] For this reason, there has been very little work in
trying to use measured BRDFs for computer graphics work.

<p>
One paper that does present a method for acquiring BRDFs is [Ward 92]. Instead
of distributing the necessary four degrees of freedom among surface, camera,
and light source motion, as is customary in BRDF measurement, Ward built an
imaging reflectometer that uses the two degrees of freedom inherent in a
camera imaging system to reduce the number of moving parts. The complete
system includes a collimated light source, a half-silvered hemispherical
mirror, and a fisheye lens. Thus, the system captures the light reflected
into all directions at once, since the mirror reflects all the reflected
light back to the fisheye lens.

The clever optical setup of Ward's device allowed him to acquire a complete
BRDF in only a few minutes, including time to manually rotate the sample.  The
quality of the data, however, was not very high.  This diagram from Ward's
paper shows the large amount of noise present in the data he acquired, and the
limitations on his field of view. Since Ward fit his data to a model with a
small number of free parameters, these were not major problems. They confirm,
however, how difficult it is to measure BRDFs, even with careful attention to
the measuring apparatus.

<h3>
3  BRDF Representation Techniques
</h3>
<p>
Given the size and high dimensionality of BRDFs, techniques must be developed
to store and compute them efficiently. After a brief look at simple techniques,
like storing and interpolating raw data samples or evaluating physically-based
models on the fly, we will focus on a collection of representations that
allow BRDFs to be stored compactly, and computed efficiently when needed.
These techniques, to various degrees, make use of the smoothness and symmetry
properties of most BRDFs that make them easier to compress than arbitrary
four-dimensional functions.
</p><p>
</p><h4>3.1 Storage and interpolation of BRDF samples</h4>
<p>
The simplest method of BRDF representation one might envision would be to
sample the BRDF on some regular (or irregular) grid, and interpolate among the
samples when needed. This is, in fact, a popular method in conventional
scatterometry, and data obtained from large BRDF measurement laboratories is
likely to be presented in this format. Despite its simplicity, it has a number
of drawbacks for use in computer graphics.
</p><p>
First, raw data obtained from measurement is likely to be noisy, as has
already been seen [Leonard 93, Ward 92]. This leads to noisy surfaces in the
images produced using these BRDFs. Although this is not a problem in domains
such as thermal simulation [Arnold 89], it is highly objectionable in
computer graphics.
</p><p>
Even if the raw data obtained were perfect, it would still not be suitable for
direct use because of missing data.  It is impractical to measure the BRDF for
angles near grazing angles or, with most apparatus, near the backscatter angle. 
This means that there will be holes in the data wherever the incident and
outgoing directions are very close, as well as near the horizons of both the
incoming and outgoing angles.  Since grazing-angle BRDFs have a large effect on
the human perception of surfaces, it is important to have a carefully smoothed
and extrapolated BRDF near the horizon, rather than one extrapolated from raw
(noisy) data.
</p><p>
Missing data can also occur because of time constraints in measuring the BRDF. 
Because of the four degrees of freedom necessary for BRDF measurement, BRDF
scans can take a very long time.  For this reason, it is common to measure only
a relatively small number of 2-D slices through the four-dimensional space
[Leonard 93].  As a result, interpolation between these slices is not likely to
yield a satisfactory value for the BRDF of intermediate points.
</p><p>
Finally, even if the sampled data were correct and complete (e.g. obtained
from a theoretical model or Monte Carlo simulation), the storage of samples is
very inefficient because of the size of the BRDF. Storing a complete BRDF
sufficiently densely for computer graphics needs is likely to require
millions of points, and accessing this data during rendering would
significantly slow down a renderer. Again, it is the domain of computer
graphics that places specific needs on the denseness at which BRDFs need to be
stored. Ian Ashdown has obtained good results in luminaire research by using
BRDFs and luminaire photometry data sampled on rather sparse grids [Ashdown 92].
</p><p>
</p><h4>3.2 Theoretical models revisited</h4>
<p>
A common tactic in graphics is to fit measured BRDFs to analytic models.  These
models typically have a very small number of free parameters, and so the fit
can cope rather easily with noise and missing data.  In addition, since only
these best-fit parameters need to be known to reconstruct a BRDF, storage is
very efficient.  Nevertheless, using these theoretical models is problematic
because of computational complexity and the comparative lack of flexibility.
</p><p>
Because of their complexity, theoretical models of BRDFs tend to be inefficient
to compute.  For example, evaluating He's model requires computing many terms
of a slowly-converging series [He 92].  Since during rendering this must be
done for a large number of incoming and reflected directions, the evaluation of
the BRDF can significantly slow down rendering time.
</p><p>
A more serious drawback to using theoretical models is their lack of
flexibility.  Each model, to be mathematically feasible, must make certain
restrictive assumptions on the class of surfaces it can model.  One consequence
of this has been the emergence of a large class of ad-hoc empirical models. 
For example, [Ward 92] presents an "elliptical Gaussian" model that is capable
of modeling certain kinds of anisotropy, such as that associated with brushed
metals.  It is a simple modification to a rough-surface model, with two
roughness parameters (in each of two mutually perpendicular directions) instead
of one.
</p><p>
Ad-hoc BRDF models have been used for a long time, and each domain has its
favorites.  One of the first such models was the Minnaert BRDF [Minnaert 41],
developed to characterize the reflectance of the moon:
</p><p align="center"><img src="./A Survey of BRDF Representation for Computer Graphics_files/eqn3.gif" alt="BRDF_M = rho_0 (cos theta_i cos theta_r)^(k-1) / pi."></p>
<p>
As can be seen, it is a diffuse (Lambertian) BRDF with extra lightening towards
the horizons, controlled by the "limb darkening parameter" <i>k</i>.  Models
like these are often useful, but they cannot be seen as a good general solution
in the domain of photorealistic rendering.  Aside from issues of physical
correctness, these models are applicable for only narrow classes of surfaces. 
Therefore, human intervention is required to find a model most nearly
applicable for a given surface, and even then there is no guarantee that such a
model exists.
</p><p>
It is necessary, therefore, to find a framework for representing arbitrary
BRDFs, without the waste associated with storing point samples. Four
techniques popular in recent years use splines, spherical harmonics,
wavelets, and polynomials on a disk, respectively.
</p><p>
</p><h4>3.3 Splines</h4>
<p>
One simple extension of interpolating raw data samples is to use spline patches
to represent the BRDF.  In this way, a much sparser grid can be used, and the
resulting BRDF is smoother.  In addition, noisy and missing data are not as
problematic, since they are handled by the spline fitting algorithm.  A further
advantage is that the splines are relatively easy to compute.  Nevertheless, a
spline representation of a complete BRDF can still require a large amount of
storage.
</p><p>
[He 92] presents an interesting hybrid representation based on their analytic
model, by using a precomputed spline to simplify the computationally
difficult parts of the equation. The authors report a large speedup without
sacrificing accuracy. In addition, because the spline represents only a small
component in the full equation, the storage costs are small.
</p><p>
The major problem with spline representations is that they do not explicitly
use the symmetry of most BRDFs. That is, a complex, anisotropic BRDF will
probably require about the same storage as a simple, isotropic one. The only
way to represent the symmetry is by combining the spline with an analytic
model, thus greatly restricting the kinds of BRDFs that are representable.
There is no smooth, graceful degradation in the storage costs associated with
increasingly complex BRDFs.
</p><p>
</p><h4>3.4 Spherical harmonics</h4>
<p>
A currently very common method of storing BRDFs is by projecting them onto
spherical harmonics.  These are the spherical analogues of sines and cosines,
in that they form a smooth orthonormal basis for functions on the sphere, and
are localized in the frequency domain.  These properties are useful, since it
is easy to project a BRDF onto the basis of spherical harmonics, and since
smooth, simple BRDFs will have fewer nonzero (or at least nonnegligible)
coefficients than complex ones.  The most complete treatment to date of using
spherical harmonics to represent BRDFs is [Westin 92].
</p><p>
It turns out that a naive implementation of BRDF representation in terms of
spherical harmonics has several problems. First, since the BRDF is defined on
the product of two hemispheres, rather than two spheres, there is the question
of how to fill in the missing hemispheres of data. Next, truncation of
high-frequency coefficients is likely to cause "ringing", because of the sharp
edges in frequency space. Finally, even moderately complex BRDFs require large
numbers of spherical harmonic basis functions to be represented correctly.
</p><p>
[Westin 92] uses a number of mathematical tricks to overcome some of these
limitations. First, the authors choose to fill the "missing" hemispheres with copies
of available data, rather than with zeroes. This has the effect of introducing
a symmetry into the function, which causes the coefficients of all odd
harmonics to be zero. Next, instead of representing just the BRDF, the
function they actually store is
</p><p align="center"><img src="./A Survey of BRDF Representation for Computer Graphics_files/eqn4.gif" alt="(BRDF)(cos theta_i)(cos theta_r)."></p>
<p>
This enforces continuity at the "equators" of the spheres, and helps to reduce
ringing.  They also artificially dampen certain high-frequency coefficients to
soften the edges in frequency space, and reduce ringing even further.
</p><p>
A final important feature used to simplify the BRDF representation and increase
its physical correctness is the fact that <b>Helmholtz reciprocity</b> is
enforced.  This principle, arising from the physics of reflection, states that
the BRDF must remain the same if the angles of incidence and reflection are
interchanged.  Therefore, the (four-dimensional) matrix of spherical harmonic
coefficients must be symmetric under interchange of incoming and outgoing
angles.  This not only reduces the storage requirements of the matrix, but also
enforces some basic constraints on physical correctness.
</p><p>
The spherical harmonic representation is an attractive one for describing
BRDFs, because of the mathematical and conceptual simplicity of the model.
Nevertheless, even with Westin's improvements, the number of coefficients
required to represent even moderately complex BRDFs is large. Very specular
surfaces can be expected to require impractically large numbers of
coefficients to represent the sharp reflective peaks accurately.
</p><p>
</p><h4>3.5 Spherical wavelets</h4>
<p>
One may summarize the problems with the spherical harmonic representation by
pointing out that though the basis functions are well-localized in the
frequency domain, they are not at all localized in the spatial domain.
Therefore, sharp features in the BRDFs will cause ringing in other areas
unless a large number of coefficients is used. On the other hand,
representations that are localized in space, such as splines, require many
coefficients even when the surfaces are smooth. Therefore, what is really
necessary are functions localized in both the spatial and frequency domains.
The research conducted into wavelets has shown that it is possible to find
such functions, group them into orthonormal bases, and develop efficient
algorithms for computing them.
</p><p>
The particular implementation of wavelets we will consider is that of the
"second-generation" wavelets of Sweldens and Schröder.  By using what they
refer to as a <i>lifting scheme</i>, they are able to construct wavelets on nearly
arbitrary domains, without the mathematical difficulty and other limitations
associated with classical "first-generation" wavelets.  The resulting wavelets
have compact support, smoothness (decay towards high frequencies), and
vanishing moments (decay towards low frequencies).  Wavelet coefficients can be
computed efficiently by means of a "fast wavelet transform".
</p><p>
[Schröder 95] describes a basis of second-generation wavelets adapted for
representing functions on a sphere. The functions are stored on a subdivided
icosahedron, and several classes of wavelets suitable for that basis were
found. The authors report good results in storing BRDFs using these bases,
even using relatively small numbers of coefficients. They also point out that
this representation is particularly well-suited for hierarchical illumination
algorithms, and multiresolution analysis.

<p>
According to the paper, the main cost associated with computing the wavelet
representation is determining the optimum set of coefficients to keep.  Since
this must be done once per BRDF, however, this is not a major drawback.  The
computation required to compute the BRDF for one particular pair of incoming
and outgoing angles, which is the computation performed in most conventional
renderers, is proportional to the depth to which the tree of coefficients must
be expanded, which is approximately logarithmic in the number of coefficients. 
This compares favorably with the spherical harmonic representation, which
requires computation time proportional to the number of coefficients.

<p>
</p><h4>3.6 Zernike polynomials</h4>
<p>
The preceding two approaches have been sphere-based, in that they look at
functions on a hemisphere as a special case of functions on a sphere.  An
alternative approach is to map the points on a hemisphere onto a disk.  One
recent paper explores this possibility, looking at representing BRDFs in terms
of an orthonormal basis of functions on the unit disk.
</p><p>
[Koenderink 96] starts with the Zernike polynomials, commonly used in physical
optics.  These functions are then projected onto a hemisphere using an
equal-area mapping.  The "cross-product" of these sets of functions is now
suitable for representing functions defined on a pair of hemispheres.  The
authors the observe that the set of representable functions can be restricted
to those satisfying reciprocity by forming a new basis from particular linear
combinations of the original basis functions.  Thus, the paper develops a
representation very similar to that used in [Westin 92], but optimized for the
hemisphere rather than the sphere.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the hemispherical basis shares many of the faults of the
spherical harmonic basis. The basis functions are not spatially localized, and
representations in terms of the basis are susceptible to ringing. In addition,
evaluating the BRDF at a particular incoming and outgoing angle requires
computation time proportional to the number of nonzero coefficients.
Therefore, the storage and computation costs of using the Zernike-based
representation are likely to be considerable. Creating a basis specialized to
the hemisphere, though, is a good idea, and might be applicable to other
methods, such as wavelets.
</p>

<h3>
4  Future Directions in BRDF Representation
</h3>
<p>
We will now look at some areas for possible future research in BRDF
representation.  In general, there is a need both for more efficient and
computationally inexpensive BRDF representations, and for extended (especially
spatially-varying) BRDFs.
</p><p>
</p><h4>4.1 Making BRDF representations more efficient</h4>
<p>
It is interesting to note that the most popular surface reflectance model
currently in use is the Phong model.  The reason for this is simplicity - the
Phong model gives results that are often "good enough", and it can be computed
extremely quickly.  This shows that BRDF representations can succeed even if
they are not extremely accurate, provided BRDF computations do not
significantly slow down the renderer.  The problem with current BRDF
representations is that they introduce visible and objectionable artifacts
(e.g.  the ringing associated with spherical harmonics) when the BRDFs are
compressed too much.  Therefore, it would be useful to find methods that are
free of such visually jarring artifacts, even when relatively few coefficients
are kept.
</p><p>
One approach to improving BRDF representation is to use more of the symmetries
present in most natural BRDFs.  The most obvious example here is Helmholtz
reciprocity - it would be interesting to add this constraint to the spherical
wavelet representation.  A second, potentially more useful, symmetry arises
from the fact that most BRDFs are very similar when looked at from the
direction of natural reflection.  That is, if for a given incident direction we
look at the pattern of reflected light centered around the direction of the
mirror reflection of the incident ray, this pattern (ignoring the effects of
the horizon) will vary slowly with the direction of the incoming ray. 
Therefore, if we perform a change of basis before we represent the BRDF we
should see slow variation along one axis, potentially leading to better
compression. The challange of dealing with the "moving" horizon in this new
basis, however, might make implementing such a change of basis impractical.
</p><p>
A second idea for improving BRDF storage is to use a combination of one of the
flexible methods (such as the wavelet representation) and a simple analytic
model.  For example, we could perform a best fit of the data to Ward's Gaussian
model, and represent the residual using the wavelet basis.  This should provide
much better performance, especially in quickly-varying BRDFs.  In fact, this is
possibly the only solution for representing BRDFs with sharp specular peaks
without using large numbers of coefficients.
</p><p>
A final idea for improving BRDF representation deals with color.  Most papers
on representation pay little attention to color, assuming that whatever
representation is chosen can simply be repeated three times for the red, green,
and blue components.  It might make more sense, though, to use an HSV basis to
represent color.  For many BRDFs, the variation in one or more of these
components will be minimal.  For example, many plastics will exhibit variation
only in saturation and value, while metals will vary only in value, except near
grazing.  Switching to an HSV basis should require little change in the
representation algorithms, except perhaps to deal with the wrap-around of the
hue component.
</p><p>
</p><h4>4.2 Representing more general reflectance functions</h4>
<p>
True photorealistic rendering will require that we re-introduce some of the
dimensions we dropped from the BRDF.  For example, to obtain physically
accurate results when there are multiple reflections in a scene, we need a
better model of color, and some provisions for polarization.  Color should be
fairly easy to improve, either by sampling the visible spectrum or by using
some basis functions.  Polarization, however, is more difficult, since in the
general case we need to account for linear, circular, elliptical, or random
polarization, or combinations of all of these.  A simple start might be to
represent the BRDFs for linearly polarized incident rays only, storing the
values for polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence. 
This will allow for the modeling of the most important polarization-related
effect, namely the total linear polarization of light reflected at Brewster's
angle from a dielectric.
</p><p>
The most important dimensions to be added, though, are the spatial ones.  BRDFs
naturally vary with position on a surface, and it is important to model this
variation.  The problem is, of course, that adding these two additional
dimensions will greatly increase the size of the data set.  Although it should
be possible to represent entire six-dimensional spatially-varying BRDFs
directly, it is probably much more practical to use some approximate methods. 
For example, one can conceive of a surface representation that has a small set
of basis BRDFs, and a sampled or procedurally generated "texture mask" that
modulates between them.  This would be a natural extension of conventional
texture maps and bumpmaps, and should be capable of accurately reproducing a
large class of real-world materials.
</p><p>
It might also be interesting to incorporate BRDFs into texture synthesis
algorithms, such as those presented in [Heeger 95] and [Lewis 89]. One
motivating example of a situation where this might be useful is the speckle
associated with materials such as sandstone. The BRDF in this situation has
sharp specular peaks that vary randomly in orientation throughout the surface.
Other examples include coarsely-brushed finishes on metals, or cloth.
<br>
</p><h3>
5  Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Many representations for BRDFs have been proposed in the computer graphics
literature.  Of those considered here, the one based on wavelets seems to be
the most space efficient and quickest to compute.  More work is needed to make
the method more stable and free of artifacts, possibly by making use of more
symmetries and constraints.  The most important area for future research,
however, is in efficiently extending BRDF representation to accomodate spatial
variation.
