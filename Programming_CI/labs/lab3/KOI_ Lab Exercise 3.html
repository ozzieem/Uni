Creating a parser with Yacc.
(Or actually with Bison, which is the version of Yacc that we will be using.
Yacc and Bison are very similar, but there are some differences.)

<h2>Yacc and Bison</h2>

The original version of Yacc created a C file called <b>y.tab.c</b>,
with compilable C code,
and a header file called <b>y.tab.h</b>, with definitions of token codes.
With Bison,
you need to use the command-line argument "-d" to get a ".h" file.
Also, Bison doesn't use the fixed names <b>y.tab.c</b> and <b>y.tab.h</b>,
but instead uses the same base name as that of the input file,
with <b>.tab.c</b> and <b>.tab.h</b> appended.
For example, let's say we are building a parser
for a language called  DumScript. The command

<blockquote>
<pre>bison -d dumscript.y
</pre>
</blockquote>

will create the files <b>dumscript.tab.c</b> and <b>dumscript.tab.h</b>.

<p>

Yacc is very often used together with a scanner generator called <b>Lex</b>,
and Bison is very often used together with a scanner generator called <b>Flex</b>.
Flex is very similar to Lex.
(Note that there are several other computer-related things that are called Flex,
which have nothing to do with the scanner generator Flex.)



</p><h2>Bison and Flex in various environments</h2>

Some Unix and Unix-like systems, such as various Linux distributions, come with these tools already installed.
On Ubuntu 14.04, you need to install them, which can be done with the command <b>sudo apt-get install bison flex</b>.
You can then run them using the commands <b>bison</b> and <b>flex</b> in a command shell.


<p>

On Windows, you have to download and install them separately,
and it may be a bit difficult to get them to work well with Visual Studio.
There are some Windows-specific instructions in
<a href="http://basen.oru.se/kurser/koi/2016-2017-p1/windows-labbar/index.html">the old Windows version of these assignments</a>.

</p><p>

Bison should generate the C files
<b><i>something</i>.tab.c</b> and <b><i>something</i>.tab.h</b>,
and Flex should generate the C file
<b>lex.yy.c</b>.

</p><p>

You must re-run Bison and Flex whenever you have made changes to their input files,
so they generate new C source and header files.

</p><p>

To build a project that contains Bison or Flex specifications,
you can run the commands by hand,
and then compile and link the C files,
but you should automate this process as much as you can.
A simple script ("batch file") may be enough, but more advanced methods are available.
On Unix-like systems such as Linux you can use <b>make</b> to automate the build process.
(See below.)



</p><h2>Part A: Bison and Flex</h2>

Try out a simple example, which implements a calculator that understands
simple expressions.
Download the parser specification
<a href="http://basen.oru.se/kurser/koi/2016-2017-p1/linux-labbar/lab-3/example/example.y">example.y</a>
and the scanner specification
<a href="http://basen.oru.se/kurser/koi/2016-2017-p1/linux-labbar/lab-3/example/example.l">example.l</a>,
or both (and a 
<a href="http://basen.oru.se/kurser/koi/2016-2017-p1/linux-labbar/lab-3/example/Makefile">Makefile</a>)
in
<a href="http://basen.oru.se/kurser/koi/2016-2017-p1/linux-labbar/lab-3/example.zip">example.zip</a>.

<p>

Unpack, study the files, make a project, compile, and run it.
(You can either just type <b>make</b> to build the program,
using the provided
<a href="http://basen.oru.se/kurser/koi/2016-2017-p1/linux-labbar/lab-3/example/Makefile">Makefile</a>,
or look in that file for commands to give.

</p><p>

</p><ul>
<li>Study the <a href="http://basen.oru.se/kurser/koi/2016-2017-p1/linux-labbar/lab-3/example/Makefile">Makefile</a>,
    Which commands used to build <b>example</b> are written explicitly in the file?
    Are there some commands that <b>make</b> will deduce by itself?
</li><li>Which types of expressions does the calculator understand?
</li><li>One common operator is missing. Which one?
</li><li>Add the missing operator!
</li></ul>



<h2>Part B: The calculator</h2>

Replace your hand-coded parser 
in the <a href="http://basen.oru.se/kurser/koi/2016-2017-p1/asu-86/29/files.html">2.9 program</a>
from <a href="http://basen.oru.se/kurser/koi/2016-2017-p1/linux-labbar/lab-2/index.html">lab exercise 2</a>
with a Yacc-generated parser.
The program should still generate postfix output and calculate the result.

<p>

With a hand-coded parser, it was difficult to handle both assignments and expressions.
Let your Yacc grammar handle both, and see how easy it is!

</p><p>

Some more things to do:

</p><ul>
<li>
You can declare <b>yyerror</b> in the "definitions" part of
the Yacc input file: <b>extern void yyerror(char*);</b>

</li><li>
We must also define <b>yyerror</b> somewhere in the program,
and a good place to do that is in the "subroutines" part of the Yacc input file.

</li><li>
Yacc expects the scanner to be called <b>yylex</b>,
since this is the name of the function generated by Lex and Flex.
Define such a function (again, in the "subroutines" part of the Yacc input file),
and let it call the old scanner function, <b>lexan</b>.

</li><li>
The parser function generated by Yacc will be called <b>yyparse</b>,
but the program in which we will plug it in
expects the parser function to be called <b>parse</b>.
One way to handle this is to define a <b>parse</b> function,
which just calls <b>yyparse</b>.

</li><li>
Yacc generates its own token codes for <b>ID</b>, <b>NUM</b> etc.
Obviously, the scanner must use the same token codes, and not the
(different) ones that we used before.
Therefore you should change the header file <b>global.h</b>,
and replace the old definitions of token codes
with an <b>#include</b> of the Yacc-generated header file <b><i>something</i>.tab.h</b>.
</li></ul>

There is a sample Yacc input file that (sort of) works with the 2.9 program
in the lecture notes for
<a href="http://basen.oru.se/kurser/koi/2016-2017-p1/forelasningar/fo-05/index.html#yacc-example">lecture 5</a>.



<h2>Part C: More operators</h2>

Implement the following operators from C and C++, in the grammar,
in the postfix translator, and in the calculator:

<ul>
<li><b>%</b> (a synonym for <b>mod</b>)
</li><li><b>&amp;</b> (bitwise and)
</li><li><b>|</b> (bitwise or)
</li><li><b>&lt;</b>
</li><li><b>&gt;</b>
</li><li><b>?:</b> (as in <i>expr1</i> <b>?</b> <i>expr2</i> <b>:</b> <i>expr3</i>)
</li></ul>

Multi-character operators, such as <b>==</b> and <b>++</b>,
would require changing the scanner, so for now we wait with those.

<p>

In C and in C++, the <b>?:</b> operator only evaluates one of the expressions
<i>expr2</i> and <i>expr3</i>.
If you want, you can instead let your operator evaluate both <i>expr2</i> and <i>expr3</i>.



</p><h2>Part D: Yacc and C++</h2>

Make a copy of your entire project, and then compile this copy program, including the Yacc-generated parser,
as C++ instead of C.

<p>

The original Yacc was designed to accept C code in the semantic actions,
but later versions, such as Bison, also allows C++.
If the input file ends with <b>.ypp</b> instead of <b>.y</b>,
Bison will
automatically give its output file a C++ extension.
For example, if you call the input file <b>language.ypp</b>,
the command <b>bison -d language.ypp</b>
will generate the output files
<b>language.tab.cpp</b> and <b>language.tab.hpp</b>.

</p><p>

C++ is more picky with declarations than C is,
so you may have to add some declarations
in the definitions part of the Yacc input file.
Something like this might work:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote>
<pre>%{
  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
  #include "global.h"
  extern int tokenval;
  extern void yyerror(char*);
  extern int yylex();
%}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

To avoid linking problems when mixing C and C++ source files,
change all other C files that your program uses
(<b>main.c</b>, <b>lexer.c</b> etc)
to have C++ extensions (<b>main.cpp</b>, <b>lexer.cpp</b> etc).

</p><p>

(And yes, C and C++ are two different languages.
You have to be a bit careful if you mix them in the same project.)
