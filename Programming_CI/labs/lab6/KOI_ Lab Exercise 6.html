<h1><a href="http://basen.oru.se/kurser/koi/2016-2017-p1/index.html">KOI</a>: Lab Exercise 6</h1>

This exercise is about a (comparatively)
simple way to build an interpreter,
by executing the syntax trees.


<h2>Executing syntax trees</h2>

Write an interpreter that executes the syntax trees from
<a href="http://basen.oru.se/kurser/koi/2016-2017-p1/linux-labbar/lab-5/index.html">lab 5</a>.

<p>

One way is to write a recursive function,
called for example <b>execute</b>,
that takes a pointer to a tree node as argument.
This function should examine the type field
in the node, and, depending on the type of node,
perform the proper action.

</p><p>

For example, if the type of node is '+',
your function should first evaluate (that is, "calculate the value of")
the arguments,
by calling itself recursively with the two sub-trees of the nodes
as arguments.
Then it should perform the addition,
and finally return the result.

</p><p>

Control structures, such as the <b>if</b> statement,
can be handled in a similar way,
except that sometimes some arguments should <i>not</i>
be evaluated.  



</p><h2>Report!</h2>

Show your results and discuss them with the teacher,
<br>
<i>or</i>,
<br>
send an
<a href="mailto:Thomas.Padron-McCarthy@oru.se?subject=KOI%20lab%206">e-mail</a>:
<ul>
<li> 
The e-mail should contain clear and full explanations of what you have done.
</li><li>
Include well-chosen and commented test runs with input and output.
</li><li>
Send your e-mail in plain text format,
not as HTML or Word documents
or with unnecessary attachments.
</li><li>
Include relevant source code, with any changes clearly marked.
</li><li>
Except for this report, you should <i>also</i> send all
the source code that is required to compile the program,
as a Zip file or equivalent.
</li></ul>
