# UniCpp
Almost all the coding I'm doing relating to university courses.

Programming C has all assignments from the C-course.

C++ Laborationer has all the assignments from the OOP course.

Programmeringsteknik has all the assignments from the Python summer course in OOP.

Small projects folder contains really small projects that I created when I started learning C++ or just want to try out small things.
