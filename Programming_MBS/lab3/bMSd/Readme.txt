| Basic Multibody Simulator Derived (Matlab toolbox) |
------------------------------------------------------

This is a Matlab toolbox that can be used to perform kinematic and dynamic simulation and analysis
of open-loop manipulator systems with a free-floating base. It is developed for educational purpose.

I do NOT claim originality of the algorithms used nor the implementations made, a part of the code
is "borrowed" from:

1. "The SpaceDyn" 
http://www.astro.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/spacedyn/index.html

2. "Robotics Toolbox" 
http://www.petercorke.com/Robotics%20Toolbox.html

3. "Mbs3D" 
http://mat21.etsii.upm.es/mbs/matlabcode/Mbs3dv1.0/mba3d.htm

I did not aim at developing an efficient simulator, but rather one that can easily be understood by
students.

Any questions or remarks are mostly welcome! 

Not that it matters but, please note that: 
----------------------------------------- 
The files in this toolbox might contain a lot of bugs that can crawl out of your computer and put
your house on fire! I guess what I am trying to say is that YOU ARE USING THIS TOOLBOX AT YOUR OWN
RISK.

Please feel free to copy and modify any part of the code!  

INSTALLATION:
-------------
Simply include the functions in your Matlab path
(the file setup_bMSd.m can do that for you)
