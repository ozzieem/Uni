<h1>Laboratory 3 - Navigation control <em>(assigned on Sep 12)</em></h1>

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>Implement point-to-point navigation control as explained in lecture 3</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
<li>Implement one of the two "GoTo()" procedures.
<p>
</p></li><li>Tune the GAIN parameters to obtain a good behavior.
<br>Make sure to test your tuned GoTo() with many different goal points.
<br>Print the actual trajectory followed by the robot: (x,y) coordinates at each cycle.
<p>
</p></li><li>Implement the "Track()" procedure.
<br>It you may prefer to use GoTo2() for this one (why?)
<br>Make sure to test your Track() with many different paths.
<br>Print the actual trajectory followed by the robot: (x,y) coordinates at each cycle, 
and compare it with the given path.
</li></ol>

<h3>Optional parts</h3>

<ol start="4">
<li> Change the sampling time to be 20 times slower or 20 times faster,
and re-tune the gains: are they different?  Why?
<p>
</p></li><li> Implement the other "GoTo()" procedure.
<br>Tune it and test is as above.
<p>
</p></li><li> [Advanced] Change your "GoTo()" procedure to include also an Integral term
and/or a Derivative term.  Can you observe an improvement in the
behavior of the robot when going to a target point?
<p>
</p></li><li> [Advanced] Write a more general procedure that also accepts an orientation for
the target position.  Try to implement it using either the "divide et
impera" approach or the MIMO one.
<p>
</p></li><li> [Advanced] Describe in your report how you would realize a proportional
controller to solve the "osbtacle avoidance" problem, using input from
the IR sensors.  You do not need to actually implement it, but you may
try if you wish!
<p>
</p></li><li> [Advanced] Describe in your report how you would realize a proportional
controller to solve the combined "go-to-goal" and "osbtacle avoidance"
problem.  You do not need to actually implement it, but you may
try if you wish!
<p>
</p></li><li> Include some obstacles in your playground, and write by hand a few paths to go from some point A to some point B, going around your obstacles.  
Try to lay down the waypoints in different ways: e.g., use just a few waypoints at the important turning points, or use many waypoints to mark precisely the path.  
Can you observe any difference?  Why?  
Try to use look-ahead points. 
Try with a very cluttered obstacle course.
<!--
<p>
<li> [This option is based on the 2nd part of the lecture, given on Sep
16] Implement the GoTo rule-based controller, and test it with different
start and goal positions. 
<p>
<li>Implement the AvoidObstacles rule-based controller, and test it with
different configurations of obstacles and obstacles of different colors
<p>
<li>Tune the parameters used to set the FPreds until you obtain a good behavior
<br> (for AvoidObstacles you also need to tune the value of DangerThreshold)
<p>
<li> Try to modify the rules in the behavior: can you find a simpler set of rules?
<br> Can you find a better set of rules?  Explain your findings, in all cases.
<p>
<li> Implement a FollowObstacle behavior as hinted at at the lecture, and test it
-->
</li></ol>

<h3>Report due: September 23</h3>

<p>Discuss how the tuning of the parameters have been done, and show the values adopted</p>

<p>Specify which sampling time you have used.</p>

<p>Tell which goal points you have used, and show the trajectories made
by the robot.  Do that in a graphical format if you can, that is, put
the (x,y) points generated by your robot in a file and use some program
to make a plot (Matlab, Gnuplot, etc).  You may also include a series of
photos taken while your robot moves from start to end, especially if you
did option 10.</p>

<p>Describe the optional parts, if you did any.</p>
