===============================================================================
Writing Lab Reports:

  -First: SEPARATE Cover Page
    -Course name (e.g. "AIMR", or "Artificial Intelligence in Mobile Robots")
    -Lab assistant's name (e.g. "Delivered to: Ali Adbul Khaliq")
    -Lab number and title (e.g. "Lab 2 - Position Estimation", or "Final Project")
    -Group number, member names, personal ID numbers, and email addresses
    -Date when lab was performed, and date when report was submitted

  -Second: SEPARATE Text Section
    -In English (we can accommodate Swedish if needed: please talk to us)
    -About 2 page for labs (not including code/figures)
    -Section 1:
      -State lab objectives, and overview.
    -Section 2:
      -Explain what you did, and how you did it.  This section should explain
       what was done for EACH POINT of the lab assignment (use appropriate
       subsections - refer to lab description).  In particular, indicate which
       sections refer to optional parts.  Indicate which optional parts were
       done, and how.
    -Section 3:
      -Conclusions.  Explain problems encountered and solutions used (don't
       mention pure programming problems or hardware problems).  Explain how
       well the resulting program worked, and how it might be improved.

  -Third: SEPARATE Appendix
    -Include COMMENTED source code, figures, program output, etc.
    -Only include data which is necessary to show that the lab was successful
    -Include only the code relevant to the particular lab

===============================================================================
===============================================================================
Submitting Lab Reports:

  -Submit perforated and stapled paper copies of lab reports to lab assistant
    -Bring to lab, drop off in office, or drop in mail slot at the department

  -Reports which are not good enough will be returned, to be resubmitted

  -Reports are due 10 days the lab was assigned
    -Late lab reports can negatively affect your grade (see below)
    -Reports judged as inadequate should be re-submitted in an adequate form
     the following week, and will be considered late
    -Any missing lab reports by FINAL deadline = FAIL

  -YOU CAN FAIL THIS COURSE IF...
    -You do not submit approved lab reports for all labs by the FINAL deadline
    -You do not demonstrate a working project by the FINAL deadline
    -You do not submit an approved final report by the FINAL deadline
    -Exceptions MIGHT be made if you have a valid, verifiable reason

  -YOU CAN GET A PERFECT SCORE FOR THIS COURSE IF...
    -You submit all lab reports, demos, and final reports, on time
    -You submit lab reports which meet format specifications, and which have
     content which is consistent with the specifications
    -You complete a substantial number of optional parts for the final project

Other Important Information About Labs:

  -Attendance at labs is compulsory, until at least the mandatory parts of the
   lab are completed.  Absenteeism must be explained, and if you miss labs
   without good reason this could affect your grade.

  -Remember to sign the attendance sheet before leaving the lab, and if you've
   demonstrated a lab be sure it is marked on the attendance sheet

  -Use the same computer and robot throughout the course.

  -Do not bring food or drink anywhere near the computers/robots.

  -You will not have time to finish all the options by the time allocated
   for the final project.  Many of the options are the same options that are
   given during the previous labs - so you might want to complete as many
   options as possible in each of the labs.

  -Before moving on to lab N, you should DEMONSTRATE that you have successfully
   implemented (at least the mandatory parts of) lab N-1.  You should demo all
   parts of the lab at the same time (i.e. when you're finished all mandatory
   parts, and any optional parts you intend to complete).  Demos for labs and
   the final project should be on the REAL robot: you may use a simulator, 
   but just as a tool to speed up rough development.

  -If you fall behind, there are a few "extra" lab slots available.  It is
   your responsibility to let us know (during the normal lab slot) if you feel
   you need extra time in the lab.  We encourage you to do as much work as you
   can outside the lab if you feel you're falling behind.  Extra time slots are
   only available to students who have not missed labs without good reason.

  -If for a (good) reason your group cannot attend a lab as scheduled, contact
   the lab assistant to determine when you can do the lab.  

===============================================================================
Information about robots:

  -They are EXPENSIVE.  Handle with care.

  -Some of them may be worn.  In particular, if you start moving too fast,
   sometimes one wheel will reach full speed faster than the other, causing a
   lurch which can make position estimation difficult.  If this happens, slow
   down.

  -You cannot take the robots out of the lab, sorry.  If you need to do
   work off the lab, you can use the simulator for that.
