<h1>Laboratory 4 - Fuzzy rule-based control <br><em>(assigned on Sep 19)</em></h1>

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>Implement and test a fuzzy rule-based controller for your ePuck robot.</p>


<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
<li>Implement the fuzzy "GoTo" rule-based controller, and test it
with different start and goal positions.
<p>
</p></li><li>Tune the parameters used to set the FPreds until you obtain a
good behavior.
<p>
</p></li><li>Implement the fuzzy "AvoidObstacles" rule-based controller,  and
test it with different configurations of obstacles and with obstacles
<br> of different colors. 
<p>
</p></li><li>Tune the values of the two Thresholds and of the parameters used to
set the FPreds until you obtain a good behavior.
</li></ol>

<h3>Optional parts</h3>

<ol start="5">
<li> Try to modify the rules in the GoTo behavior: 
Can you find a simpler set of rules?
Can you find a set of rules that behaves better?
Explain your findings, in either case.
<p>
</p></li><li> Try to modify the rules in the AvoidObstacles behavior: 
Can you find a simpler set of rules?
Can you find a set of rules that behaves better?
Explain your findings, in either case.
<p>
</p></li><li>[Advanced] Implement a FollowObstacle behavior, and test it.
<p>
</p></li><li>[Advanced] Invent and implement another type of behavior (e.g.: follow
the perimeter, go between two opposite corners, approach a light
source, dock to a given position and angle, ...) 
<p>
</p></li><li> Implement an integrated controller to go to a goal point and avoid
obstacles at the same time, by combining the two fuzzy rule-based
controllers above.
</li></ol>


<h3>Report due: Sep 30</h3>

<p>Include (only) your code, with comments.</p>

<p>Discuss how the testing has been done, tell how the robot behaved
with obstacles of different colors and shape, and show the trajectory
of the robot in a few sample runs.
Try to use some graphical tool (eg, Matlab or gnuplot) to plot the trajectory.
</p>

<p>Discuss how the tuning have been done, and show the trajectory of the
robot in a case with good tuning and in a case with bad tuning.  
Explain what was bad in the bad tuning.
</p>

<p>If you did optional tasks 5 or 6, discuss how you have changed the
rules and why.</p> 

<!--
<p>If you did optional tasks 11 (or beyond) in Lab 3, discuss if and how
you have found the crisp controller different from the fuzzy one.  Is
the behavior of the robot different?  Is tuning of the parameters easier
or more difficult?</p>
-->

<p>If you did optional tasks 7 or 8, discuss all the above points for
the additional behavior(s) as well.</p>
