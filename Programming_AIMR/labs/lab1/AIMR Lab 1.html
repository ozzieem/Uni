<h2>Laboratory 1 - Getting started <em>(assigned on Sep 5, report due on
Sep 15)</em></h2>

See the course homepage
(<a href="http://aass.oru.se/~asaffio/Teaching/AIMR/">http://aass.oru.se/~asaffio/Teaching/AIMR</a>)
for information about how to write and submit lab reports, due dates, linux help, etc.

<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>Learn how to run your programs on the robot, run some test programs,
and write and use a few simple programs of your own.</p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<ol>

  <li>
  Familiarize yourself with the Linux installation on your computer.
  Open an editor and write a simple C program -- e.g., the usual "hello
  world" that you find in all C books or online.  Try to compile it and
  run it.  Make sure you are confortable with the file system, the
  editor, and the compiler.   Be sure to <b>thoroughly</b> read the
  linux tips document
  (<a href="http://aass.oru.se/~aakq/AIMR/linuxtips.txt">http://aass.oru.se/~aakq/AIMR/linuxtips.txt</a>).
  </li>
<p>
  </p><li>
  Go to the course homepage and read all the documentation you find.
  Answers to many of your questions can be found here.  In addition to
  the linux tips document above, be sure to <b>thoroughly</b> read the
  lab report specifications document
  (<a href="http://aass.oru.se/~asaffio/Teaching/AIMR/labinfo.txt">http://aass.oru.se/~asaffio/Teaching/AIMR/labinfo.txt</a>).
  Download the latest source code
  (<a href="http://aass.oru.se/~aakq/AIMR/AIMR_2016.tar.gz">http://aass.oru.se/~aakq/AIMR/AIMR_2016.tar.gz</a>)
  and extract it.  Take a close look at the include file <tt>epuck.hpp</tt>.
  Also, take a look at <tt>lists.h</tt> and <tt>maps.h</tt>: they will be needed
  in later labs.
  </li>
<p>
  </p><li>
  View the readme file, and follow the instructions to compile the code for the
  robot.  <b>Ask for help connecting the robot</b>, and then run the sample
  program on the robot.  Describe what each part of the sample program does.
  </li>
<p>
  </p><li>
  View the readme file, and follow the instructions to compile the code for the
  simulator.  Start the simulator, and then run the sample program on the
  simulator.  Describe what each part of the sample program does, and compare
  this to the results obtained on the real robot.
  </li>

  </p><li>
  Make the robot move using the
  <font color="#008000">SetTargetSteps()</font> function.  Try various values,
  including values which are very different for each wheel.  How does this
  function work?  
  What happens when you try
  <font color="#008000">SetTargetSteps(2000,3000)</font>?  Why?
  </li>
<p>
  </p><li>
  Make the robot move using the <font color="#008000">SetSpeed()</font>,
  <font color="#008000">Stop()</font>, and
  <font color="#008000">Sleep()</font> functions.  Try various values,
  including values which are very different for each wheel.  How does this
  function work?  Why do you need to use the
  <font color="#008000">Sleep()</font> function?  What is the maximum speed
  allowed by the software (see the epuck.hpp header file)?  Try sending
  <font color="#008000">SetSpeed(300,400)</font> to the robot for a very short
  time.  Why doesn't the robot turn?
  </li>
<p>
  </p><li>
  Make the robot go back and forth 5 times between two points using the
  <font color="#008000">SetTargetSteps()</font> and
  <font color="#008000">Sleep()</font> functions.
  </li>
<p>
  </p><li>
  Make the robot go back and forth 5 times between two points using the
  <font color="#008000">SetSpeed()</font>,
  <font color="#008000">Stop()</font>, and
  <font color="#008000">Sleep()</font> functions.
  </li>
<p>
  </p><li><b>(Optional)</b>
  Write a function called <font color="#008000">Move(double mm)</font>, that
  moves the robot a specific number of mm (positive = forward, negative =
  backward), using <font color="#008000">SetTargetSteps()</font>.
  Try printing out the values of the steps after the robot reaches
  the target.
  </li>
<p>
  </p><li><b>(Optional)</b>
  Write a function called <font color="#008000">Turn(double degrees)</font>,
  that turns the robot the given number of degrees (positive = counterclockwise),
  using <font color="#008000">SetTargetSteps()</font>.
  </li>
<p>
  </p><li><b>(Optional)</b>
  Write another version of the <font color="#008000">Move()</font>
  function, this time using <font color="#008000">SetSpeed()</font> and
  then calling <font color="#008000">GetSteps()</font> until the
  robot has traveled the desired amount of space, and finally calling
  <font color="#008000">Stop()</font>.  Try printing out the values
  of the steps during the motion of the robot.  Also, note how long
  it takes for the steps values to stop changing.  Is the resulting
  motion more precise or less precise than the previus version of
  <font color="#008000">Move()</font>?
  </li>
<p>
  </p><li><b>(Optional)</b>
  Write yet another version of the <font color="#008000">Move()</font>
  function, using <font color="#008000">SetSpeed()</font> and then 
  <font color="#008000">Sleep()</font> for the amount of time needed to
  reach your position.  Is this third version more precise or less
  precise than the previus two?  Explain why.
  </li>
<p>
  </p><li><b>(Optional)</b>
  Write your own program which makes the robot react to the infra-red sensors in
  some way: e.g., you can blink the leds, retract from an obstacle, 
  go toward an obstacle, or other.  Use the <font color="#008000">GetIR()</font>
  function.  Describe what your program does, and how.
  </li>
